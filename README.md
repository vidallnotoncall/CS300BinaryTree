Throughout the CS300 course I was attempting to learn which form of database design would be best suited to developing for a school based on specific criteria. I approached this problem by analysing exactly what it was the client was asking for and which type of database would benefit the end system based on the user criteria presented. Its important to understand databases because although they all handle data they are each good at diiferent things. When approaching the difficulties surrounding the implentation of these databases I made sure to look for real life examples and study code where they had already been implemented properly. Before when I used to code I didnt really understand the importance of a database design. I understood they were important to some extent and for some reason but now with newfound understanding I can create code that handles data much more efficiently and with better speed.
